Debian packaging notes by Graeme Humphries <graeme@sudo.ca>:

Because the build depends on the AMD App SDK (which isn't packaged for Debian yet), this can't be built precisely like
a normal Debian package. Here's a few short steps on how to get it building correctly:

* Install AMD App SDK per the README.
* Install and configure pbuilder (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PbuilderHowto)
* cd into this source directory, and create a fake upstream tarball:
	tar -cJvf ../bfgminer_${VERSION}.orig.tar.xz *
* Build the package using pbuilder:
	pdebuild
* The built package should end up in /var/cache/pbuilder/results

Debian packaging depends on new release versions being entered into debian/changelog. The versions in that file need
the Debian/Ubuntu release specific suffix (0precise1) as all packages go into a shared pool, and so they need to have distinct
names for different releases.

When a new release happens, just add it with some brief changelog notes to that file, and it should be ready
to generate a new source package and upload to the Launchpad PPA.
